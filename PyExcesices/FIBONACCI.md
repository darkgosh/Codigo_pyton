# 26 FIBONACCI :
The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical pattern creditec to italian mathematician Fibonacci in 13th century.
(though others had discivered it even earlier).

The squence begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is always the sum of the previous two numbers.

The sequence continues forever:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987...

The Fibonacci sequence has application in music composition, stock market prediction, the pattern of florets in the head of sunflowersm and many others areas.

This program lets you calculate the sequence as high as you are willing to go.
